            <h2 style="color:#FF0;">Homeless Cop</h2>
<p>            The ultra crispy oil paintings of Homeless Cop are trying to have sex with your eyes. These candy colors and bold lines live and breathe out a crazy world of monsters and men, ghosts and Gods, and this all looks really, really cool. There are battles and epic moments taking place in another dimension, where style and integrity win kingdoms. Perhaps there is a secret story, but there is a mysteriously likeable universal appeal, and the attention to detail is noticeable. Homeless Cop works really hard on his paintings, and his biggest accomplishment so far has been getting his art on Adult Swim. "I've always painted things I like. People, places, and things. My whole life I've been drawing and painting, and I really feel like I was born to do this. I think my work evolves in terms of subject matter, but the execution just stays true to my style. My paintings look look like a robot made them, and I get a lot of pleasure being able to say I made them with my hands. My favorite artist is Jean-Michel Basquiat, and my favorite band is Nirvana. I also like pizza."</p>
